Purpose of these Chart classes
---

These chart classes were taken from ILIAS trunk rev 55'779
in order to backport spider charts to ILIAS 4.3.x.

To avoid name collisions, the classes are suffixed with '50'


ilChartGrid was modified to support setting the min and max value of an axis. This might be part of ILIAS trunk soon.
